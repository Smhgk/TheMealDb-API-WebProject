# TheMealDbApi-WebProject

This project is a modern web application built with ASP.NET Core, Bootstrap, and TheMealDB API. It allows users to search for meals, view detailed recipes, and explore random meals effortlessly.

It was a project where I tried to learn and reinforce Authorization with Token for Secure Web APIs. Using JWT Token, I aimed to ensure that non-authenticate users cannot access the API.
